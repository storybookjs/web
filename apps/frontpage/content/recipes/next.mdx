This recipe assumes that you have a Next >= 12 app. Don’t have this? Follow Next's [setup instructions](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) then run:

```shell
# Add Storybook:
npm create storybook@latest
```

</Callout>

## Set up your project

### In a project without Storybook

Follow the prompts after running this command in your Next.js project's root directory:

```shell
npm create storybook@latest
```

### In a project with Storybook

This framework is designed to work with Storybook 7. If you’re not already using v7, upgrade with this command:

```shell
npx storybook@latest upgrade
```

#### Automatic migration

When running the upgrade command above, you should get a prompt asking you to migrate to `@storybook/nextjs`, which should handle everything for you. In case that auto-migration does not work for your project, refer to the manual migration below.

#### Manual migration

Install the framework:

```shell
yarn add -D @storybook/nextjs
```

Update your `main.js` to change the framework property:

```js
// .storybook/main.js

export default {
  // ...
  framework: {
    // name: '@storybook/react-webpack5', // Remove this
    name: '@storybook/nextjs-vite', // Add this
    options: {},
  },
};
```

If you were using Storybook plugins to integrate with Next.js, those are no longer necessary when using this framework and can be removed:

```js
// .storybook/main.js

export default {
  // ...
  addons: [
    // ...
    // These can both be removed
    // 'storybook-addon-next',
    // 'storybook-addon-next-router',
  ],
};
```

#### (Experimental) SWC support

If you're working with a Next.js project that already uses SWC (e.g., version 14 or higher), you can enable it in Storybook by adding the following to your `main.js`:

```js
// .storybook/main.js

export default {
  // ...
  framework: {
    name: '@storybook/nextjs-vite',
    options: {
      builder: {
        useSWC: true, // Enables SWC support
      },
    },
  },
};
```

<Callout variant="info" icon="💡">

SWC support was introduced in version 7.6, is currently experimental, and may not work for all projects. If you encounter any issues, contact us by [opening a discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/new?category=help).
