title: 'Storybook 10.0 - October 2025'
---

Storybook 10 contains one breaking change: it’s ESM-only. This simplifies our distribution and reduces install size by 29% while simultaneously unminifying dist code for easier debugging.

It also includes features to level up your UI development, documentation, and testing workflows:

- 🧩 Module automocking for easier testing
- 🏭 Typesafe CSF factories Preview for React
- 💫 UI editing and sharing optimizations
- 🏷️ Tag filtering exclusion and configuration for sidebar management
- 🔀 Svelte async component support and more

This is a major release, so there are tons of little fixes and improvements. Browse the [changelogs](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/CHANGELOG.md) for the full list of changes.
