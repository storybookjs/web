title: Storybook for Svelte & Vite
---

Storybook for Svelte & Vite is a [framework](../contribute/framework.md) that makes it easy to develop and test UI components in isolation for applications using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

<If notRenderer='svelte'>
  <Callout variant="info">
    Storybook for Svelte & Vite is only supported in [Svelte](?renderer=svelte) projects.
  </Callout>

  {/* End non-supported renderers */}
</If>

<If renderer='svelte'>
  ## Requirements

  * Svelte ≥ 4.0
  * Vite ≥ 4.0
  * Storybook ≥ 8.0

  ## Getting started

  ### In a project without Storybook

  Follow the prompts after running this command in your Sveltekit project's root directory:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="init-command.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  [More on getting started with Storybook.](./install.md)

  ### In a project with Storybook

  This framework is designed to work with Storybook 7+. If you’re not already using v7, upgrade with this command:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-upgrade.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  #### Automatic migration

  When running the `upgrade` command above, you should get a prompt asking you to migrate to `@storybook/sveltekit`, which should handle everything for you. In case that auto-migration does not work for your project, refer to the manual migration below.

  #### Manual migration

  First, install the framework:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="svelte-vite-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  Then, update your `.storybook/main.js|ts` to change the framework property:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="svelte-vite-add-framework.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  ## Writing native Svelte stories

  Storybook provides a Svelte addon maintained by the community, enabling you to write stories for your Svelte components using the template syntax. You'll need to take some additional steps to enable this feature.

  Run the following command to install the addon.

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="svelte-csf-addon-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  <Callout variant="info">
    The community actively maintains the Svelte CSF addon but still lacks some features currently available in the official Storybook Svelte framework support. For more information, see [addon's documentation](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-svelte-csf).
  </Callout>

  ## API

  ### Options

  You can pass an options object for additional configuration if needed:

  ```js
  // .storybook/main.js
  import * as path from 'path';

  export default {
    // ...
    framework: {
      name: '@storybook/svelte-vite',
      options: {
        // ...
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  The available options are:

  #### `builder`

  Type: `Record<string, any>`

  Configure options for the [framework's builder](../api/main-config-framework.md#optionsbuilder). For this framework, available options can be found in the [Vite builder docs](../builders/vite.md).

  {/* End supported renderers */}
