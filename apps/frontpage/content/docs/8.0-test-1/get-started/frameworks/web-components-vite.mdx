title: Storybook for Web components & Vite
---

Storybook for Web components & Vite is a [framework](../contribute/framework.md) that makes it easy to develop and test UI components in isolation for applications using [Web components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

<If notRenderer='web-components'>
  <Callout variant="info">
    Storybook for Web components & Vite is only supported in [Web components](?renderer=web-components) projects.
  </Callout>

  {/* End non-supported renderers */}
</If>

<If renderer='web-components'>
  ## Requirements

  * Vite ≥ 4.0
  * Storybook ≥ 8.0

  ## Getting started

  ### In a project without Storybook

  Follow the prompts after running this command in your Web components project's root directory:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="init-command.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  [More on getting started with Storybook.](./install.md)

  ### In a project with Storybook

  This framework is designed to work with Storybook 7+. If you’re not already using v7, upgrade with this command:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-upgrade.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  #### Automatic migration

  When running the `upgrade` command above, you should get a prompt asking you to migrate to `@storybook/web-components-vite`, which should handle everything for you. In case that auto-migration does not work for your project, refer to the manual migration below.

  #### Manual migration

  First, install the framework:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="web-components-vite-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  Then, update your `.storybook/main.js|ts` to change the framework property:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="web-components-vite-add-framework.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  ## API

  ### Options

  You can pass an options object for additional configuration if needed:

  ```js
  // .storybook/main.js
  import * as path from 'path';

  export default {
    // ...
    framework: {
      name: '@storybook/web-components-vite',
      options: {
        // ...
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  The available options are:

  #### `builder`

  Type: `Record<string, any>`

  Configure options for the [framework's builder](../api/main-config-framework.md#optionsbuilder). For this framework, available options can be found in the [Vite builder docs](../builders/vite.md).

  {/* End supported renderers */}
