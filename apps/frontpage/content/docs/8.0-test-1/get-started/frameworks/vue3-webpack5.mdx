title: Storybook for Vue & Webpack
---

Storybook for Vue & Webpack is a [framework](../contribute/framework.md) that makes it easy to develop and test UI components in isolation for [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) applications built with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

<If notRenderer='vue'>
  <Callout variant="info">
    Storybook for Vue & Webpack is only supported in [Vue](?renderer=vue) projects.
  </Callout>

  {/* End non-supported renderers */}
</If>

<If renderer='vue'>
  ## Requirements

  * Vue ≥ 3.0
  * Webpack ≥ 5.0
  * Storybook ≥ 8.0

  ## Getting started

  ### In a project without Storybook

  Follow the prompts after running this command in your Vue project's root directory:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="init-command.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  [More on getting started with Storybook.](./install.md)

  ### In a project with Storybook

  This framework is designed to work with Storybook 7+. If you’re not already using v7, upgrade with this command:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-upgrade.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  #### Automatic migration

  When running the `upgrade` command above, you should get a prompt asking you to migrate to `@storybook/vue3-webpack5`, which should handle everything for you. In case that auto-migration does not work for your project, refer to the manual migration below.

  #### Manual migration

  First, install the framework:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="vue3-webpack5-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  Next, install and register your appropriate compiler addon, depending on whether you're using SWC (recommended) or Babel:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-addon-compiler-swc-auto-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  or

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-addon-compiler-babel-auto-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  More details can be found in the [Webpack builder docs](../builders/webpack.md#compiler-support).

  Finally, update your `.storybook/main.js|ts` to change the framework property:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="vue3-webpack5-add-framework.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  ## Extending the Vue application

  Storybook creates a [Vue 3 application](https://vuejs.org/api/application.html#application-api) for your component preview.
  When using global custom components (`app.component`), directives (`app.directive`), extensions (`app.use`), or other application methods, you will need to configure those in the `./storybook/preview.js` file.

  Therefore, Storybook provides you with a `setup` function exported from this package, which receives as a callback your Storybook instance, which you can interact with and add your custom configuration.

  ```js
  // .storybook/preview.js

  import { setup } from '@storybook/vue3';

  setup((app) => {
    app.use(MyPlugin);
    app.component('my-component', MyComponent);
    app.mixin({
      /* My mixin */
    });
  });
  ```

  ## Troubleshooting

  ### Storybook doesn't work with my Vue 2 project

  [Vue 2 entered End of Life](https://v2.vuejs.org/lts/) (EOL) on December 31st, 2023, and is no longer maintained by the Vue team. As a result, Storybook no longer supports Vue 2. We recommend you upgrade your project to Vue 3, which Storybook fully supports. If that's not an option, you can still use Storybook with Vue 2 by installing the latest version of Storybook 7 with the following command:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-init-v7.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  ## API

  ### Options

  You can pass an options object for additional configuration if needed:

  ```ts
  // .storybook/main.ts
  import type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/vue-webpack5';

  const config: StorybookConfig = {
    framework: {
      name: '@storybook/vue-webpack5',
      options: {
        // ...
      },
    },
  };

  export default config;
  ```

  #### `builder`

  Type: `Record<string, any>`

  Configure options for the [framework's builder](../api/main-config-framework.md#optionsbuilder). For this framework, available options can be found in the [Webpack builder docs](../builders/webpack.md).

  {/* End supported renderers */}
